I'm a software engineer based in Bali, Indonesia. Specializing in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional websites, applications, and everything in between.

I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.
